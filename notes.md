## AWS

My IP address is: at the moment, not determined. I still need to figure out if I want to pay for an elastic IP address.
I had no problems creating and connecting to my AWS. As of this moment, my SSH connect command is thus:
- ssh -i ~/Documents/Webserver-key-01.pem ubuntu@54.164.179.151
  
## Caddy
This was... very frustrating.

## HTML
I plan on getting around my unfamiliarity with HTML by heavily borrowing from the simon code. By editing and messing with an already-formatted example, I can avoid having to start from scratch while still progressing.

Successful in this regard.
