[My Notes](notes.md)

This is a fundamentally basic game/chatroom webspace designed to grow my skills in animation and game design. 

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Users will be able to control a little avatar of their choice around a grid-based map and chat with other users on the software. They can play games with each other, catch up on life, and experience fun, satisfying controls and animations that other games lack.

### Design

![Design image](temporary.png)

Users will be able to move their avatar around a map and message other players. Functionality like ramming and sprinting will be included in the movement system.

### Key features

- Instant messaging with other users on the game.
- Reactive movement that allows for a tactile and interactive experience.
- Satisfying mechanics that lead to relaxation.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** -  Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages, One for login and one for playing the game. Hyperlinks to save a certain avatar for repeat use.
- **CSS** - Aims for a rather minimalist style that goes easy on the eyes while still featuring bright colors and attractive designs.
- **React** - Provides login, avatar choice, instant messaging, display of other users' messages, and backend endpoint calls. Single page application that is reactive to user's actions.
- **Service** - Backend Services include:
  - retrieving movement commands
  - storing user messages
  - displaying user messages in the game UI
  - allowing the user to display images of dogs with the https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random service. 
- **DB/Login** - Store users, messages, and avatar choices in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't play unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcast messages to other players currently active in the game.
